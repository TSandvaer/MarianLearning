# PreToolUse guard (Far Horizon) -- LAYER 2 of the destructive-command block.
#
# Layer 1 = the permissions.deny globs in settings.json. Those are prefix-globs
# and can be dodged by flag reordering (e.g. `git --hard reset`, `git push origin
# main --force`). This hook is the arg-order-robust backstop: it returns a
# PreToolUse "deny" (eval order is deny -> ask -> allow, so deny overrides
# bypassPermissions per the 2026-06-18 permission-precedence research) whenever a
# command matches force-push / reset --hard / recursive-force delete (bash or
# PowerShell) / repo delete / force branch delete -- regardless of flag order.
#
# Destructive actions are on the never-auto-decide list: the orchestrator must
# STAGE them to .claude/away-queue.md, not run them. The deny reason says so.
#
# SCOPING (ticket 86cabe3gx, memory destructive-bash-hook-matches-whole-input):
# we match ONLY the parsed `.tool_input.command` field -- NEVER the whole flattened
# JSON -- AND we strip QUOTED SPANS from that command before matching. Matching the
# whole blob (or the raw command) caused two failure classes:
#   (1) FALSE POSITIVE -- a destructive phrase appearing only in NON-executed text:
#       the `description` field, OR a quoted commit-message / PR-body argument
#       (e.g. `git commit -m "explain why rm -rf is dangerous"`, `gh pr create
#       --body "...git push --force..."`). The message/body is data, not a command.
#       Field-scoping drops the `description`; quote-stripping drops the -m / --body
#       text so a destructive phrase inside it can no longer trip the pattern.
#   (2) FALSE NEGATIVE -- a command that STARTS with the destructive verb slipped
#       past, because in the flattened JSON the verb was preceded by `"command":"`
#       (a double-quote, not in the leading-anchor class), so a leading `rm -rf ...`
#       failed the `(^|[[:space:]...])rm` anchor. Extracting the command string puts
#       the verb genuinely at `^`, so leading recursive-deletes are caught.
#
# A REAL destructive command keeps its verb + flags OUTSIDE the quotes
# (`rm -rf "/path with spaces"`, `git push --force origin main`), so quote-stripping
# never removes the part that matters -- it only removes message/body payloads.
#
# Fail-OPEN: any read/parse problem -> exit 0 (allow). This is a safety backstop,
# not a correctness gate; a missed block is better than a false wall.
#
# grep only for matching (Git Bash on Windows lacks jq). One Python step extracts
# `.tool_input.command`, strips quoted spans, and flattens newlines (Python ships
# with Git Bash / the runner); on any failure it emits empty -> fail-open.

# --- git force-push (any flag order) ---
# The LEASE-BASED family is deliberately ALLOWED: `--force-with-lease` and its
# companion `--force-if-includes` refuse the push if the remote moved under you,
# so they cannot silently clobber someone else's work -- which is the harm this
# check exists to prevent. Bare `--force` / `-f` stay blocked.
#
# Narrowed 2026-08-02 (Thomas's call) after the original all-force pattern blocked
# a legitimate rebase recovery on this project's own alignment PR #490: rebase-then-
# force-with-lease is routine here, so the guard was firing on the safe form several
# times a week. See .claude/alignment/alignment-plan-Far-Horizon-2026-08-02.md V-2.
#
# `--force` must be followed by space / quote / end so it does NOT substring-match
# `--force-with-lease` or `--force-if-includes`. Verified by scripts/smoke-destructive-hook.sh.
#
# The FLAG check is CASE-SENSITIVE (no -i) -- second instance of the same class of
# bug as the `-D`/`-d` one above. Git's force flags are lowercase (`--force`, `-f`);
# uppercase `-F` is an unrelated flag (`git commit -F <file>`, read message from
# file). With -i, the short-flag alternation matched `-F`, and because this hook
# sees the WHOLE compound command as one string, an ordinary
# `git commit -F - && git push origin main` tripped BOTH conditions and was denied
# as a force-push. Hit 2026-08-02 committing this very file's sibling change.
