# SessionStart hook — re-arms the auto-status loop if it was left enabled
# before this session started.
#
# The auto-status loop is session-scoped: it dies on session restart / resume /
# clear. This hook reads the durable intent from .claude/auto-status.state and,
# if auto-status was left enabled, injects context telling the orchestrator to
# re-arm the loop in the recorded mode. This is the restart-survival mechanism —
# without it, re-arming depends on the user remembering.
#
# Deliberately NOT matched on `compact`: compaction keeps the same session, so
# the loop may still be alive — re-arming there risks stacking a second loop.
# A loop that dies mid-session (rare) is surfaced via a stale `last_tick`, which
# the no-arg `auto-status` command reports.
#
# On a `resume` start it ALSO injects a one-line FRESH-SCAN nudge (imported from
# Far-Horizon 2026-08-02): a resumed session's save-state is STALE, not current
# truth, so before concluding the board is drained the orchestrator must run a
# fresh whole-board scan. The nudge is non-blocking additionalContext; it appends
# to the re-arm context when auto-status was enabled, and stands alone otherwise.
#
# Always exits 0; never blocks.

This session was RESUMED — a prior session's save-state is STALE, not current truth. Before concluding the board is drained, run a FRESH whole-board scan (ClickUp MCP over the Marian Tutor list, via a subagent — it overflows context) plus \`gh pr list --state open\`, and fill-or-justify every idle persona slot. Do not trust a remembered 'all gated' / 'drained'.

Note the standing counterweight in CLAUDE.md § 'Idle is free; an unjustified dispatch is the bug': scan the WHOLE board so you never wrongly conclude 'all gated', but having scanned, dispatch only what earns its cost. A justified idle slot is a valid scan outcome."

auto-status was left **enabled** before this session (mode=\`$MODE\`, interval=\`$INTERVAL\`, last_tick=\`${LAST_TICK:-never}\`).

The auto-status loop is session-scoped and does NOT survive a session restart — so it is **not running right now**. Re-arm it as your first action this session: invoke the \`auto-status\` skill with argument \`$MODE\` (use \`on\` if mode is \`local\`). Do this before handling the user's request, unless the user's first message explicitly turns auto-status off."
