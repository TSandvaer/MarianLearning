/**
 * App shell.
 *
 * Routing is intentionally a tiny piece of local state — see
 * `src/router/route.ts` for the rationale. Session 1 is a fixed linear
 * sequence; we don't pay the bundle cost of react-router until URLs become
 * a real requirement (parental dashboard / return-user flow).
 *
 * Motion is wrapped here so every screen can use `<m.*>` without each one
 * paying the LazyMotion init cost. Reduce-motion is honoured globally:
 * iPad's "Reduce Motion" accessibility toggle collapses springs to fades
 * and freezes infinite-repeat pulses. Each screen still gets the same
 * markup — no per-screen branching for the a11y path.
